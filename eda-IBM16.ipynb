       "'A video game content rating system is a system used for the classification of video games into suitability-related groups. Most of these systems are associated with and/or sponsored by a government, and are sometimes part of the local motion picture rating system. The utility of such ratings has been called into question by studies that publish findings such as 90% of teenagers claim that their parents \"never\" check the ratings before allowing them to rent or buy video games,[REF] and as such calls have been made to \"fix\" the existing rating systems [REF]. Video game content rating systems can be used as the basis for laws that cover the sales of video games to minors, such as in Australia. Rating checking and approval is part of the game localization when they are being prepared for their distribution in other countries or locales. \\nThese rating systems have also been used to voluntarily restrict sales of certain video games by stores, such as the German retailer Kaufhof\\'s removing all video games rated 18+ by the USK following the Winnenden school shooting [REF].\\n\\nThe upheaval struck on two fronts. First were the arcades, hit with the release of Mortal Kombat, a fighting game of unprecedented violence. With heightened realism provided by the use of digitized actors rather than hand-drawn characters, the game featured vicious combinations of fighting moves, Romero-worthy bloodletting and vocal exhortations to \"finish\" your enemy with special \"fatalities.\" Possibly the most controversial fighting game ever released, Mortal Kombat\\'s blend of over-the-top violence and thrilling fights proved irresistible to gamers, turning it into a tremendous success and laying the foundation for a franchise that continues to this day. \\n\\nThen came the home market later that same year, faced with a similar assault in the guise of the infamous Night Trap. With over an hour and a half of full-motion video and a production cost of $1.5 million, Night Trap told the story of a slumber party gone wrong and the young, nightgown-wearing houseguests who must be saved from horrible fates by the voyeuristic gamer. A commercial flop, the game\\'s sexually exploitative setting and gameplay nonetheless made it a focal point of Congressional hearings on offensive videogame content. \\n\\nLed by U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl, a Congressional hearings on offensive video game content ran from late 1992 into 1993, and resulted in an ultimatum for the industry: Form a workable, self-regulated rating system for videogames within one year, or prepare for the U.S. federal government to implement one of its own. The threat of government regulation led to the formation of not just one but a handful of rating schemes from different corners of the industry. \\n\\nSega of America led the charge with the short-lived Videogame Rating Council. Established in 1993, the system was intended to cover all U.S. releases of games for the Sega Genesis, Game Gear and Sega CD. The VRC featured three ratings: General Audiences, MA-13 (Parental Discretion Advised) and MA-17 (Not Appropriate For Minors). The system was simultaneously simplistic and confusing; the lack of rating detail, combined with Sega\\'s failure to document or explain their meaning, often left consumers puzzled over the actual nature of the game\\'s content. \\n\\nAlso founded in 1993 was the 3DO Rating System, for games released in North America on the 3DO console. Similar to Sega\\'s VRC, the 3DO Rating System was even narrower in focus - 3DO games only, which were scant in number - and featured four vague but easy-to-follow ratings: E (Everyone), 12 (Parental Guidance for 12 and Under), 17 (Parental Guidance for 17 and Under), and AO (Adults Only). In a significant improvement over Sega\\'s VRC, details of the in-game content would be contained on the back of the box. \\n\\nBut neither of these systems adequately addressed the demands of the U.S. Congress, and neither survived to see the close of 1994. They did, however, provide a template for a third and somewhat more successful attempt at a comprehensive rating system that would satisfy videogaming critics: The Software Publishers Association\\'s Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC). The RSAC provided five levels of ratings in the categories of Violence, Nudity-Sex and Language. Despite the lack of an age-based rating, the system was more detailed than its predecessors while remaining comparatively simple to understand, and for awhile it saw reasonably widespread acceptance. Unfortunately, it suffered from one major, fatal flaw: The RSAC system was for PC software only, therefore inapplicable to console releases. This limitation, exacerbated by the 1995 debut of the explosively popular PlayStation console, rendered the RSAC system all but irrelevant, and in 1999 it quietly passed on. \\n\\nThe big dog in the fight was the result of the April 1994 formation of the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), a trade group assembled from the most powerful game developers and publishers in the country. In July 1994, the IDSA (renamed to the Entertainment Software Association in 2003) presented to Congress its proposal for an industry-controlled rating system; in September of that same year, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was unveiled. \\n\\nInitially, the ESRB system included five ratings: Early Childhood, Kids to Adults, Teen, Mature and Adults Only. Over the years the system would mature and be refined to meet the needs of both a growing industry and an expanding gamer demographic. The rating stamps would change to become more visible, and in 1998 the Kids to Adults rating was replaced with an Everyone (E) rating. Content descriptors have been changed and added over the years, giving greater specificity to the ratings. Currently, the ESRB uses a two-tiered system with six age-based ratings, complemented by 32 content descriptors that offer detailed information about a game, including the presence of everything from crude humor to tobacco references and animated blood [REF].\\n\\nSimilar to other forms of media, video games have been the subject of argument between leading professionals and restriction and prohibition. Often these bouts of criticism come from use of debated topics such as video game graphic violence, virtual sex, violent and gory scenes, partial or full nudity, portrayal of criminal behavior or other provocative and objectionable material. \\n\\nVideo games have also been studied for links to addiction and aggression. Several studies have found that video games do not contribute to these problems. Further, several groups have argued that few if any scientifically proven studies exist to back up these claims, and that the video game industry has become an easy target for the media to blame for many modern day problems [REF]. Furthermore, numerous researchers have proposed potential positive effects of video games on aspects of social and cognitive development and psychological well-being [REF]. It has been shown that action video game players have better hand-eye coordination and visuo-motor skills, such as their resistance to distraction, their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than non-players [REF].\\n\\nThe Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is a self-regulatory organization that assigns age and content ratings, enforces industry-adopted advertising guidelines, and ensures responsible online privacy principles for computer and video games and other entertainment software in Canada and the United States [REF].\\n\\nThe Australian Classification Board (ACB) is a statutory classification body formed by the Australian Government which classifies films, video games and publications for exhibition, sale or hire in Australia since its establishment in 1970. The Australian Classification Board was originally incorporated in the Office of Film and Literature Classification which was dissolved in 2006. The Attorney-General\\'s Department now provides administrative support to the Board. Decisions made by the Board may be reviewed by the Australian Classification Review Board.\\n\\nThe British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), originally British Board of Film Censors, is a non-governmental organisation, funded by the film industry and responsible for the national classification of films within the United Kingdom [REF]. It has a statutory requirement to classify videos, DVDs and some video games under the Video Recordings Act 2010 [REF].\\n\\nThe Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC, ) is the government agency in New Zealand that is responsible for classification of all films, videos, publications, and some video games in New Zealand. It was created by the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 (FVPC Act), replacing various film classification acts, and is an independent Crown Entity[REF] in terms of the Crown Entities Act 2004. The head of the OFLC is called the Chief Censor, maintaining a title that has described the government officer in charge of censorship in New Zealand since 1916.\\n\\nPan European Game Information (PEGI) is a European video game content rating system established to help European parents make informed decisions on buying computer games with logos on games boxes. It was developed by the Interactive Software Federation of Europe (ISFE) and came into use in April 2003; it replaced many national age rating systems with a single European system. The PEGI system is now used in more than thirty countries and is based on a code of conduct, a set of rules to which every publisher using the PEGI system is contractually committed. PEGI self-regulation is composed by five age categories and eight content descriptors that advise the suitability and content of a game for a certain age range based on the games content [REF]. The age rating does not indicate the difficulty of the game or the skill required to play it [REF].\\n\\nFinnish Board of Film Classification (in Finnish Valtion elokuvatarkastamo (VET), in Swedish Statens Filmgranskningsbyrå (SFB)) is the Finnish Board of Film Classification. \\n\\nVET/SFB is an official institution of the Finnish Ministry of Education. It is responsible for inspecting and rating the content of films and interactive games. Only material intended to be accessible to minors (those under 18 years of age) is subject to mandatory inspection before being released to the public; sex films do not need review though the board can watch it if they choose. A proper notification is usually sufficient for adult material, but the board has the right to inspect any material suspected of violating laws or material which was not properly notified of. Until 2001 VET also inspected material intended for adult audiences and could prevent releasing it in Finland if the board deemed it exceedingly violent.\\n\\nUnterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (USK) (Self-Monitoring of Entertainment Software), is Germany\\'s software rating organization founded in 1994.\\n\\nThe Department of Justice, Rating, Titles and Qualification (DJCTQ\\') (Departamento de Justiça, Classificação, Títulos e Qualificação in Portuguese) rates films, games and television programs in Brazil. It is controlled by the Ministry of Justice (Ministério da Justiça).\\n\\nThe (CERO) is the organization that rates video games and PC games (except dating sim, visual novel, and eroge) in Japan with levels of rating that informs the customer of the nature of the product and for what age group it is suitable. It was established on July 2002 as a branch of Computer Entertainment Supplier\\'s Association, and became an officially recognized non-profit organization in 2003.\\n\\nThe (EOCS) is the incorporated association that rates PC games (dating sim, visual novel, and eroge) in Japan.\\n\\nThe (CSA) is the cooperatives that rates PC games (dating sim, visual novel, and eroge) in Japan.\\n\\nThe Game Rating Board (게임물등급위원회 Geimmul Deung-Geub-Wiwonhoe) (GRB) is the South Korean video game content rating board. A governmental organization, the GRB rates video and computer games to inform customers of the nature of game contents.\\n\\nThe Computer Software Rating Regulation (電腦軟體分級辦法) (CSRR) is a rating system used in the Republic of China (Taiwan) for computer software, including computer/console/handheld games. Arcade game machines has a separate regulation and is not governed by the CSRR.\\n\\nEntertainment Software Rating Association () (ESRA) is a governmental video game content rating system that is used in Iran. Games that cannot be rated are considered illegal and cannot be sold.\\n\\nThe Independent Game Rating System (TIGRS) is a free self-rating system for video game entertainment products. Many developers and publishers of Internet-available games have decided by their own volition to rate their games to educate audiences about potentially objectionable content in the games [REF].\\n\\nApple rates applications worldwide based on their content, and determines what age group each is appropriate for. According to the iPhone OS 3.0 launch event, the iPhone will allow blocking objectionable apps in the iPhone\\'s settings.\\n\\nNewgrounds rates content in their site to see what is suitable for that person. It is like the ESRB, but it has 4 ratings instead of 6. \\n\\n\"Suitable for Everyone\" - no inappropriate content . \\n\\n\"Suitable for 13+\" - may contain mild violence, mild explicit audio/text, and adult themes . \\n\\n\"Suitable for 17+\" - may contain excessive violence, explicit adult themes and audio/text, and mild nudity . \\n\\n\"Suitable for Adults Only\" - may contain excessive violence, explicit adult themes and audio/text, and excessive nudity .\\n\\nBallston Spa New York Video Games rates content with the US movie ratings, G, PG, PG-13, R, I, and X. \\n\\n\"G\" - Suitable for everybody . \\n\\n\"PG\" - Suitable for children 7 and up and adults . \\n\\n\"PG-13\" - Suitable for children 13 or above and adults . \\n\\n\"R\" - Suitable for adults only . \\n\\n\"I\" - Suitable by law for adults only . \\n\\n\"X\" - Unplayable without permission by government, violators will be prosecuted .\\n\\nExplanations of specific ratings are available in corresponding articles.\\n\\nThe image below presents usage of various video game content rating systems around the world. Countries filled with gradients are using several rating systems.'"

    "a1 += \"In other parts of the country, calls in for universal basic income are growing. In California, Silicon Valley has made well known their support for a basic income citing the necessity of social security from the jobs they will take away with their businesses. In the media, a cursory search of liberal publications reveals a bolder comfort with an idea of providing a stipend to people for doing nothing. In Georgia, former documentary assistant turned congressional candidate, Jon Ossoff, went above and beyond agreeing to a $15 minimum wage and instead gave a nod to his California benefactors by saying he would push for a “living wage” in the final debate for the Georgia Sixth Congressional district special election. It’s easy to see the sly rhetorical distinction between “living wage” and “basic income.”There is very little hope that this trend will change without forward-thinking leaders who will refuse to rest on lazy ideas like the universal basic income.Our politicians have been able to see technology replacing jobs for decades now and made little adjustments other than to make more individuals reliant on the government for their economic well being. I echo what I wrote in The Hill last September that automation would require lawmakers to be innovative in their approaches for creating jobs. Many lawmakers and those in the best position to see automation replacing jobs, such as CEO’s in Silicon Valley, it would appear are opting towards a more top-down income redistribution in the form of a universal basic income rather than wrestle with retraining workers, re-calibrating the economy, or encouraging innovation to offset job loss.This is to simply say: universal basic income is a lazy, socialist solution to future unemployment problems. There are dozens of issues with universal basic income, but I will list some of the bigger issues below. As to avoid being an armchair critic who only points out mistakes, I will also offer up some of my own solutions or alternatives to reposition our economy.First, universal basic income stifles economic growth through exorbitant tax rates. To pay for a basic income that would be a living income or sustainable income requires taxation of wage earners well above 50% for the highest and second highest tax brackets. Offsetting high cost of living cities like New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. would necessitate a tax rate unsustainable for most Americans. This leads to either a subsidy for poor Americans, or force many low-income individuals to relocate out of major cities. Needless to say, this exodus hampers innovation.With our current immigration debate, this analysis presumes a comparable rate of illegal immigration and immigration as we have seen in recent years. If history is any indication, the moment a universal basic income comes into law for U.S. citizens, Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo will rush to the front of public debate to argue that universal basic income should be extended to undocumented workers as well since it’s a human right. If that happens, keep your wallets open because that’s going to hurt.Second, universal basic income is a mere proxy for socialism. The plan relies on the assumption that the income will be a social safety net to hedge against unemployment. In a perfect world, individuals would be able to save to offset economic unpredictability. This is an interesting argument to hear coming from a Left who finds the thought of alternatives to social security and Obamacare in the form of private savings account abhorrent. If liberals don’t trust Americans to allocate their money correctly, how can they reasonably suspect that this universal income will be treated differently to realistically serve as a safety net?Finally, a basic universal income only hedges against future unemployment rather than creating opportunities in the present to anticipate economic changes. If automation continues to replace jobs, more Americans will shift from universal basic income being a subsidy to their earned wages towards it being a necessity in unemployment. It’s easy to see how this would spiral the economy into the garbage heap. As workers exit the workforce, fewer workers pay into the pool for distribution meaning that there is less money for the same amount of government handouts. To accommodate the gap, either taxes would have to go up on higher income earners to account for a depleting workforce, or businesses and the government would have to create alternatives to get people to work, or the government would have to require businesses to hire individuals. (Beginning to sound a bit like Atlas Shrugged.) All are bad alternatives. Creating a safety net that promises no ability to put people to work is giving them $1,000, not teaching them to build boats or sail, and asking them to get off an island.There is still time to right the ship. As I said at the outset, nay saying without a solution is as empty as the politicians that will inevitably thrust the universal basic income upon us. There are many avenues to avoiding the calamity from unemployment Silicon Valley predicts from their innovation. I will list several here.First, public schools and innovative STEM charter schools need the resources to teach STEM subjects and trade skills. Understanding how the workforce is being educated and what they are learning are far too often overlooked. For one, a realistic alternative would be to increase trade skills education during high school education while it is cheaper in order to provide career paths for students that do not seek a college degree while equipping them with a skill. It will be a long time before a plumber or electrician can be replaced by a machine. Access to STEM early in education will also improve female participation in STEM fields which has been noticeably absent and will lead to greater market participation in a field that will continue to grow as automation boxes out other fields. Targeting areas that lead to innovation and businesses can allocate resources will put people to work.Please do not misinterpret me to suggest that we need more education. I’d wager there are less than 1,000 people in America using an art history degree for its intended purpose. Instead, this is a proposal to reallocate resources to target types of education where humans will be valuable – trades that machines have difficulty replacing and STEM fields where humans create the machines who replace them.My second proposal is to unburden small businesses. Legislators should be in the business of making it easier for small businesses to operate and comply with government regulation. If state and federal regulation is reduced, small businesses will be best situated to create jobs cheaply. Healthcare constantly being in flux, taxation changes, and legal hurdles make running a small business and creating jobs difficult and in an economy that many predict will desperately need to create employment, government doesn’t need to be a formidable burden in that process.My proposals are not perfect. There are plenty of holes in these proposals and many require intensive policy debates. The debates are worth having because a universal basis income is a road towards a dying economy – settling on a universal basic income is both lazy and simplistic. Without real ingenuity in the way we approach our workforce, we may be doomed to an economy bereft of innovation and liberty.\""

While it was hardly the first step in the firm’s competitive evolution, Friday’s breathtaking news that the e-commerce giant will acquire Whole Foods brings into sharp focus one of the deepest tensions in our antitrust law as it has evolved under 40 years of conservative orthodoxy. Amazon is enormous, and it is apparently rapacious and remorseless. But at least superficially, it has done nothing in its 20-year life but sell things more cheaply and innovatively than its competitors. That is to say that it’s done just the thing that antitrust law says firms are supposed to do: It has competed on price and quality. The law has therefore proven persistently uninterested in its conduct.While this new merger must undergo federal antitrust review, the Trump administration is unlikely to challenge it. The Obama administration probably wouldn’t have either, and neither would a Clinton administration. That is because, given the state of the law and the attitude of our judiciary, making a case against this deal will seem very challenging indeed. Our antitrust law, as it has come to be, is poorly equipped to deal with a company like Amazon. (Disclosure: Slate is an Amazon affiliate; when you click on an Amazon link from Slate, the magazine gets a cut of the proceeds from whatever you buy.)To many critics, that antitrust is so helpless in the face of a firm so big, acquisitive, and devastating proves how badly it has failed. Its failure, then, reflects an even larger tension, especially on the American left. The struggle is between the haughty pride of our establishment institutions and their apparent impotence against the power and greed from which they are supposed to protect us. The fear and resentment of the poisonous 2016 Democratic presidential primary was driven by nothing less.The better news is that debate over Whole Foods, which seems likely to be pretty lively, could be a bit of a watershed moment for our competition policy. Ideally, recognition might emerge that antitrust as it has evolved, including even its general, simple focus on price competition and protection of consumers, is actually a reasonably tolerable policy. It generates good outcomes most of the time and could get better yet just with more vigorous enforcement and popular support. But hopefully we also will see that a firm like Amazon embodies some things that are wrong with the policy and that it calls for action.That action could actually be taken in the Whole Foods case, and it is not even impossible that the Trump administration might take it. There are a few theories of actionable anticompetitive harm, even on our existing law, by which the government could bring challenge. They will require digging more deeply than the superficial story that Amazon will tell in its own defense, but they won’t require any radical change to the law we’ve got. The new administration ought to take them seriously.Up until now, the mainstream antitrust establishment has been pretty quiet about Amazon, no doubt because its visible conduct fits awkwardly with current ideas of what should be illegal. The Whole Foods acquisition could change that, if for no better reason that it represents a new level of audacity. Though Amazon has acquired hundreds of other firms in the past, some big and many controversial, never before has it bought a significant brick-and-mortar operation. Over the years, as its critics have raised increasingly urgent alarms and elaborated on the firm’s history of fairly nasty aggression, what’s angered them most have been Amazon’s tentative forays into terrestrial stores of its own. They seem to confirm a deliberately predatory, monopolizing strategy: Amazon kills off brick-and-mortar retail competition through desperation prices, only to take over those rivals’ physical presence as soon as they are gone. This new deal is also a big one in absolute dollars. While Whole Foods is by no means the largest American grocer, and the deal’s $14 billion purchase price is not the biggest by any stretch, Whole Foods is among the larger chains in an industry worth upward of a trillion dollars per year. And of course, unlike any of Amazon’s prior targets, Whole Foods is among the best-known names in American retail.But still, an antitrust challenge is quite unlikely. Nowadays, the federal antitrust agencies almost never challenge mergers unless they are “horizontal”—between head-to-head competitors—and they cause very high levels of concentration. This merger is only barely horizontal. The firms’ only overlapping business is online grocery, which so far remains a vanishingly small share of overall grocery. Even if (as seems unlikely) a court found there to be a legally relevant market consisting only of online grocery sales, no serious challenge would be likely. Amazon is a big player in that small space, but Whole Foods is small within it, and there are plenty of other would-be players.Moreover, Amazon will tell a seemingly plausible story to regulators and courts—that it only means to buy a troubled firm in need of a boost and only to support its entry in a space that it could not successfully enter on its own. Amazon has been trying to get a foothold in grocery for a decade, but its only real success has been in England, where it has partnered with the traditional grocer Morrisons.Meanwhile Whole Foods has been stuck in a yearslong doldrums and this year came under dire pressure from Wall Street. Vigorous challenge from mainstream chains and superstores led to a loss of nearly half the firm’s share value over just a few years. Then, just two months ago, a surprise incursion by an activist hedge fund bred immediate speculation that Whole Foods was on the auction block.And yet there is a better way to characterize this deal and at least two good angles for legal attack. Though many Amazon critics fear it calls for some new, reconceptualized antitrust law, it actually seems nicely telling that existing law could deal with the Whole Foods acquisition and with Amazon’s behavior more generally, so long as certain established theories are taken seriously. (Such an approach is also much more politically plausible right now than any holistic, revolutionary change in the underlying law.)First is the argument that Amazon will acquire Whole Foods mainly to kill off an online grocery rival—not now but in the future. This argument would take the deal not so much as “horizontal” and so would begin at a disadvantage. But antitrust protects “dynamic” as well as static competition, and mergers are illegal where they will thwart technological or other developments that pose future competition. Amazon has a history of such maneuvers, as in its notorious, bare-knuckled acquisitions of Zappos and Diapers.com, as well as dozens of smaller acquisitions of otherwise threatening startups. While online grocery is now small, the industry plainly expects it to grow, and while there are currently several would-be entrants, there are specific reasons to expect that this combination will make their futures very, very bleak.(And while it’s not in itself legally relevant, markets have already indicated their confidence in some such anticompetitive outcome. On Friday’s announcement, Amazon’s share price rose. That likely doesn’t reflect investor expectation of efficiency-enhancing integration, because no investors really believe in such things. Wall Street so cynically discounts the motives of executives setting up mergers—something like 70 percent of which fail—that acquiring firms’ shares usually fall when deals are announced. When the acquiring firm’s stock goes up, instead, investors must expect something profitable, and it’s very unlikely they’re just buying the sing-song synergy promises that every CEO makes for every deal.)Better yet, a second theory would challenge Amazon’s conduct overall. A range of its particular actions over a few decades potentially makes out a claim, even under our current antitrust law, of illegal monopolization (in technical terms, a claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, rather than a merger challenge under Section 7 of the Clayton Act). The claim would be that this new acquisition and a series of prior acquisitions and other actions have delivered a market position in which Amazon is such a powerful buyer that it can force its suppliers to sell at subcompetitive prices. While monopsony claims are rare and difficult to bring, Amazon is no ordinary antitrust defendant. To prove the claim, the government could first show that Amazon has very large shares of sales in specific products and that those shares reflect actual market power because Amazon has acquired truly, historically unique economies of scope that no retail entrant could meaningfully challenge. The government could then show that these shares were acquired not by healthy, price-competitive vigor (in which case they would not be illegal). Rather, they were gotten through a series of acquisitions that may not have been individually illegal but in combination were monopolistic and by other exclusionary acts. A variety of the latter are well-documented, as, for example, Amazon’s use of its Amazon Marketplace platform to gather analytics on its Marketplace partners, then to enter their markets while using its data advantage and crushing terms to overtake the space.While President Trump’s antitrust leadership is not yet in place, his team appears most likely to consist of well-seasoned lawyer’s lawyers with sterling credentials in antitrust (specifically, Makan Delrahim and, as it is rumored, Joseph Simons). That they are also very conservative does not mean they won’t bring important cases, and this could be one. And the significance of it could not be overstated, not only because of Amazon’s own size and danger but for the broader revitalization it would bring to this crucial policy.\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m

    "b1 = 'Amazon is now the most interesting and important problem in American antitrust law. While it was hardly the first step in the firm’s competitive evolution, Friday’s breathtaking news that the e-commerce giant will acquire Whole Foods brings into sharp focus one of the deepest tensions in our antitrust law as it has evolved under 40 years of conservative orthodoxy. Amazon is enormous, and it is apparently rapacious and remorseless. But at least superficially, it has done nothing in its 20-year life but sell things more cheaply and innovatively than its competitors. That is to say that it’s done just the thing that antitrust law says firms are supposed to do: It has competed on price and quality. The law has therefore proven persistently uninterested in its conduct.While this new merger must undergo federal antitrust review, the Trump administration is unlikely to challenge it. The Obama administration probably wouldn’t have either, and neither would a Clinton administration. That is because, given the state of the law and the attitude of our judiciary, making a case against this deal will seem very challenging indeed. Our antitrust law, as it has come to be, is poorly equipped to deal with a company like Amazon. (Disclosure: Slate is an Amazon affiliate; when you click on an Amazon link from Slate, the magazine gets a cut of the proceeds from whatever you buy.)To many critics, that antitrust is so helpless in the face of a firm so big, acquisitive, and devastating proves how badly it has failed. Its failure, then, reflects an even larger tension, especially on the American left. The struggle is between the haughty pride of our establishment institutions and their apparent impotence against the power and greed from which they are supposed to protect us. The fear and resentment of the poisonous 2016 Democratic presidential primary was driven by nothing less.The better news is that debate over Whole Foods, which seems likely to be pretty lively, could be a bit of a watershed moment for our competition policy. Ideally, recognition might emerge that antitrust as it has evolved, including even its general, simple focus on price competition and protection of consumers, is actually a reasonably tolerable policy. It generates good outcomes most of the time and could get better yet just with more vigorous enforcement and popular support. But hopefully we also will see that a firm like Amazon embodies some things that are wrong with the policy and that it calls for action.That action could actually be taken in the Whole Foods case, and it is not even impossible that the Trump administration might take it. There are a few theories of actionable anticompetitive harm, even on our existing law, by which the government could bring challenge. They will require digging more deeply than the superficial story that Amazon will tell in its own defense, but they won’t require any radical change to the law we’ve got. The new administration ought to take them seriously.Up until now, the mainstream antitrust establishment has been pretty quiet about Amazon, no doubt because its visible conduct fits awkwardly with current ideas of what should be illegal. The Whole Foods acquisition could change that, if for no better reason that it represents a new level of audacity. Though Amazon has acquired hundreds of other firms in the past, some big and many controversial, never before has it bought a significant brick-and-mortar operation. Over the years, as its critics have raised increasingly urgent alarms and elaborated on the firm’s history of fairly nasty aggression, what’s angered them most have been Amazon’s tentative forays into terrestrial stores of its own. They seem to confirm a deliberately predatory, monopolizing strategy: Amazon kills off brick-and-mortar retail competition through desperation prices, only to take over those rivals’ physical presence as soon as they are gone. This new deal is also a big one in absolute dollars. While Whole Foods is by no means the largest American grocer, and the deal’s $14 billion purchase price is not the biggest by any stretch, Whole Foods is among the larger chains in an industry worth upward of a trillion dollars per year. And of course, unlike any of Amazon’s prior targets, Whole Foods is among the best-known names in American retail.But still, an antitrust challenge is quite unlikely. Nowadays, the federal antitrust agencies almost never challenge mergers unless they are “horizontal”—between head-to-head competitors—and they cause very high levels of concentration. This merger is only barely horizontal. The firms’ only overlapping business is online grocery, which so far remains a vanishingly small share of overall grocery. Even if (as seems unlikely) a court found there to be a legally relevant market consisting only of online grocery sales, no serious challenge would be likely. Amazon is a big player in that small space, but Whole Foods is small within it, and there are plenty of other would-be players.Moreover, Amazon will tell a seemingly plausible story to regulators and courts—that it only means to buy a troubled firm in need of a boost and only to support its entry in a space that it could not successfully enter on its own. Amazon has been trying to get a foothold in grocery for a decade, but its only real success has been in England, where it has partnered with the traditional grocer Morrisons.Meanwhile Whole Foods has been stuck in a yearslong doldrums and this year came under dire pressure from Wall Street. Vigorous challenge from mainstream chains and superstores led to a loss of nearly half the firm’s share value over just a few years. Then, just two months ago, a surprise incursion by an activist hedge fund bred immediate speculation that Whole Foods was on the auction block.And yet there is a better way to characterize this deal and at least two good angles for legal attack. Though many Amazon critics fear it calls for some new, reconceptualized antitrust law, it actually seems nicely telling that existing law could deal with the Whole Foods acquisition and with Amazon’s behavior more generally, so long as certain established theories are taken seriously. (Such an approach is also much more politically plausible right now than any holistic, revolutionary change in the underlying law.)First is the argument that Amazon will acquire Whole Foods mainly to kill off an online grocery rival—not now but in the future. This argument would take the deal not so much as “horizontal” and so would begin at a disadvantage. But antitrust protects “dynamic” as well as static competition, and mergers are illegal where they will thwart technological or other developments that pose future competition. Amazon has a history of such maneuvers, as in its notorious, bare-knuckled acquisitions of Zappos and Diapers.com, as well as dozens of smaller acquisitions of otherwise threatening startups. While online grocery is now small, the industry plainly expects it to grow, and while there are currently several would-be entrants, there are specific reasons to expect that this combination will make their futures very, very bleak.(And while it’s not in itself legally relevant, markets have already indicated their confidence in some such anticompetitive outcome. On Friday’s announcement, Amazon’s share price rose. That likely doesn’t reflect investor expectation of efficiency-enhancing integration, because no investors really believe in such things. Wall Street so cynically discounts the motives of executives setting up mergers—something like 70 percent of which fail—that acquiring firms’ shares usually fall when deals are announced. When the acquiring firm’s stock goes up, instead, investors must expect something profitable, and it’s very unlikely they’re just buying the sing-song synergy promises that every CEO makes for every deal.)Better yet, a second theory would challenge Amazon’s conduct overall. A range of its particular actions over a few decades potentially makes out a claim, even under our current antitrust law, of illegal monopolization (in technical terms, a claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, rather than a merger challenge under Section 7 of the Clayton Act). The claim would be that this new acquisition and a series of prior acquisitions and other actions have delivered a market position in which Amazon is such a powerful buyer that it can force its suppliers to sell at subcompetitive prices. While monopsony claims are rare and difficult to bring, Amazon is no ordinary antitrust defendant. To prove the claim, the government could first show that Amazon has very large shares of sales in specific products and that those shares reflect actual market power because Amazon has acquired truly, historically unique economies of scope that no retail entrant could meaningfully challenge. The government could then show that these shares were acquired not by healthy, price-competitive vigor (in which case they would not be illegal). Rather, they were gotten through a series of acquisitions that may not have been individually illegal but in combination were monopolistic and by other exclusionary acts. A variety of the latter are well-documented, as, for example, Amazon’s use of its Amazon Marketplace platform to gather analytics on its Marketplace partners, then to enter their markets while using its data advantage and crushing terms to overtake the space.While President Trump’s antitrust leadership is not yet in place, his team appears most likely to consist of well-seasoned lawyer’s lawyers with sterling credentials in antitrust (specifically, Makan Delrahim and, as it is rumored, Joseph Simons). That they are also very conservative does not mean they won’t bring important cases, and this could be one. And the significance of it could not be overstated, not only because of Amazon’s own size and danger but for the broader revitalization it would bring to this crucial policy.'"
